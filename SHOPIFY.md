payment of transactions using digital currency which is less costly and more efficient compared
to credit and debit cards where the cash transaction has to be converted which can result in losses
in income. Shopify Payments should be aggressive in the development of e-wallets to facilitate
more international trade and reduce the cost burden for the customers. In the future, more


customers will seek to make savings from online transactions and competitors are developing e-
